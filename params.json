The maximum height of the font is 255px. Custom font .h files can be generated with GLCDFontCreator2 tool (requires Java). It is included in the tools folder or you can dowload it from:<br>\r\nhttps://code.google.com/p/glcd-arduino/downloads/detail?name=GLCDFontCreator2.zip&can=2&q=<br>\r\nHere is a video of rendering a 255px-high font: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcTz_YBDXmo\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for the wiring, use Due's HW SPI pins (e.g. described here: http://21stdigitalhome.blogspot.com/2013/02/arduino-due-hardware-spi.html). A pin for CS depends on the SPI mode you choose.\r\nIf you look into ILI9341_due.h, you should find this:\r\n```Arduino\r\n// comment out the SPI mode you want to use\r\n//#define ILI9341_SPI_MODE_NORMAL\r\n//#define ILI9341_SPI_MODE_EXTENDED\t// make sure you use pin 4, 10 or 52 for CS\r\n#define ILI9341_SPI_MODE_DMA\r\n```\r\n\r\nUncomment the line depending on the SPI mode you want to use. As you can see, DMA mode is the default.\r\n\r\n<b>SPI_MODE_NORMAL</b> is the standard SPI mode where you can use any digital pin for CS but you/library has to drive it manually.<br>\r\n<b>SPI_MODE_EXTENDED</b> is the extended SPI mode available in Due where CS pin is handled by the chip (which is faster than handling it manually). You are restricted to these pins for CS though - 4, 10 and 52 (as described here: http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/DueExtendedSPI).<br>\r\n<b>SPI_MODE_DMA</b> is utilizing DMA to do SPI transfers. You should be able to use any digital pin for CS.\r\n\r\nHere is a video where you can see the speed difference: \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnEwzN14BsU\r\n\r\n```Arduino\r\n#define ILI9341_SPI_CLKDIVIDER 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is used to set the SPI clock frequency, which at 2 means 84/2=42MHz (the max). If you are getting glitches on the screen or it just does not work try to use a higher divider to bring the frequency down (e.g. 11 to run it at 8-ish MHz). I was using 20cm dupont cables to connect TFT with Due and haven't had any issues running it with the divider set to 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown bugs/issues/missing functionality:\r\n- I am sure there are bugs\r\n- sdFatTftBitmap demo not working properly\r\n- new line is not handled when rendering with gText\r\n\r\nI am not an Arduino expert so please feel free to fix/enhance this lib. I plan to add some more features (like the ones above) but I am not sure when will that happen as I have very little time to work on it (if I want to get at least 5 hours of sleep).\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis is a library for the Adafruit ILI9341 display products\r\n\r\nThis library works with the Adafruit 2.8\" Touch Shield V2 (SPI)\r\n  ----> http://www.adafruit.com/products/1651\r\n \r\nCheck out the links above for our tutorials and wiring diagrams.\r\nThese displays use SPI to communicate, 4 or 5 pins are required\r\nto interface (RST is optional).\r\n\r\nAdafruit invests time and resources providing this open source code,\r\nplease support Adafruit and open-source hardware by purchasing\r\nproducts from Adafruit!\r\n\r\nWritten by Limor Fried/Ladyada for Adafruit Industries.\r\nMIT license, all text above must be included in any redistribution\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
